    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The BackgroundMusicManager has two primary responsibilities:
    /// 
    /// 1) If the game wishes to play a song, the BackgroundMusicManager will monitor the
    ///    MediaPlayer.GameHasControl property to ensure that the game plays the music when
    ///    it is allowed, without playing over the user's music.
    /// 2) If the game's music is paused for some reason (e.g. the headphones were unplugged)
    ///    the BackgroundMusicManager will resume the playback automatically.
    ///    
    /// The BackgroundMusicManager helps not only with the Windows Phone Certification
    /// Requirements for using GameHasControl, but also makes it easier to resume media after
    /// certain events, such as watching videos or unplugging headphones, both of which will
    /// pause music with no automatic resuming.
