  <Line>From the desk of Treavor A. Pattleson: </Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>Doctor, your reports on the use of Linergy technology are</Line>
  <Line>exciting. I am glad my decision to place the project in</Line>
  <Line>such capable hands bore fruit so early. Yet, the season</Line>
  <Line>is young and I know you yearn for more boundaries</Line>
  <Line>to push, as shown by your past work.</Line>
  <Line>It's okay, doctor. You work for me, and so my protection is</Line>
  <Line>yours. Just keep the results in a financially positive</Line>
  <Line>direction and you'll find such...indiscretions of the</Line>
  <Line>past disappear like stains on a freshly cleaned suit.</Line>
  <Line>Start with the junior assistants.</Line>
  <Line>Letters have already been sent to their families.</Line>
