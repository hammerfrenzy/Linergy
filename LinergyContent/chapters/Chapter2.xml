  <Line>Our Esteemed Sponsor,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>Only a week into our geophysical survey, and already we</Line>
  <Line>have discovered rich deposits of materials that are</Line>
  <Line>exceedingly rare back home.</Line>
  <Line>Linergy, as a whole, met every one of my expectations.</Line>
  <Line>The mere efficiency of the system is enough to merit my</Line>
  <Line>accolades, but I believe enhancements can be made,</Line>
  <Line>with your help.</Line>
  <Line>I am requesting an extension of our budget -- half again</Line>
  <Line>what you provided should cover costs and materials.</Line>
