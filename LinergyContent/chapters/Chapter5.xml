  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line>We left our local nebula some weeks ago for Tureis, a</Line>
  <Line>metallic wasteland orbiting a binary star with quite the</Line>
  <Line>violent temperament. The effect on our tests has been</Line>
  <Line>interesting, at least. Forces from the twin suns spawn</Line>
  <Line>magnetic fields, drawing particles towards a fixed</Line>
  <Line>location even within the testing vacuum. The scientists</Line>
  <Line>were astonished at first, but soon leaned to take</Line>
  <Line>advantage of them to collect large quantities of energy.</Line>
  <Line>On a side note, there seems to be a viral infection</Line>
  <Line>spreading through the junior assistant dorms; many have</Line>
  <Line>been quarantined. Guess I got out at the right time!</Line>
