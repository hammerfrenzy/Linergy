  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>Three weeks we've been at this, cracking an inexhaustive</Line>
  <Line>list of particles and recording the results.</Line>
  <Line>Three weeks and I am a junior researcher no more.</Line>
  <Line>Dr. Fastian himself honored me with a promotion!</Line>
  <Line>You are now related to a fully fledged associate</Line>
  <Line>researcher for TAPTech R&amp;D. I couldn't sleep last</Line>
  <Line>night from the excitement, so I stayed up reviewing our</Line>
  <Line>recent data. Early results are more than impressive,</Line>
  <Line>but it feels like I'm missing something.</Line>
  <Line>Oh, well! That's why I'm just an associate. For now!</Line>
