  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>I was so right, and now it is too late to change anything.</Line>
  <Line>After Dr. Fastian and the other researchers retired for the night,</Line>
  <Line>I slipped into the quarantine area using an access card I lifted from a senior scientist.</Line>
  <Line>I know...old habits and whatever, but I needed to make sure. The</Line>
  <Line>beds were empty, and the place was sterile from disuse. No one</Line>
  <Line>had been in here for weeks or months, even. So, where are they?</Line>
  <Line>The records office was left unlocked, and I found exactly what I</Line>
  <Line>hoped didn't exist - test results on the junior researchers.</Line>
  <Line>They were experiemented on.</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>Brother, you must get someone out here!</Line>
