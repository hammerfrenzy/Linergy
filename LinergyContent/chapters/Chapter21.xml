  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line>Fastian thought himself smart to smoke me out of the vents</Line>
  <Line>and into the cargo bay, but the dogs he sent after the rat</Line>
  <Line>didn't expect her to swing like a lumberjack. The doctor was</Line>
  <Line>no more trouble, holed up in the central chamber. When I showed</Line>
  <Line>up, the suprise made Fastian trip into the very thing he had hoped to contain.</Line>
  <Line>You see, Linergy creates isolated cells of immense gravity to</Line>
  <Line>gather up particle energy, but it's not easy to create.</Line>
  <Line>Looking through some of Fastian's notes, it's also prone to</Line>
  <Line>imploding at a critical mass, spraying excess energy and</Line>
  <Line>devolving into a black hole unless it's kept in check.</Line>
  <Line>I don't understand how exactly, only that the energy needed was</Line>
  <Line>immense, and human lives were being used to accomplish that end. But they were rejected.</Line>
