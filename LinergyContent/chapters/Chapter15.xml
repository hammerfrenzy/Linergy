  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line>I access the terminals sparingly and only when necessary,</Line>
  <Line>so sending you messages is a low priority. I have no doubt</Line>
  <Line>Fastian was intercepting any communications to Earth.</Line>
  <Line>The remaining scientists constantly patrol the halls, hoping</Line>
  <Line>to find me, but between the air ducts and cargo hold my disappearance</Line>
  <Line>has been quite a success. 'The noose tightens around the</Line>
  <Line>relaxed neck,' you were fond of saying, though. Right</Line>
  <Line>before you joined the very agency we spent our childhood</Line>
  <Line>running from. And look what it got you - two bum legs and</Line>
  <Line>an early retirement.</Line>
  <Line>I'm hearing movement and voices.</Line>
  <Line>Time for this rat to scurry along.</Line>
