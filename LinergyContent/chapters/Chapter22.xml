  <Line>*Day 2 of debriefing of Retired Officer Gunnard Muttier*</Line>
  <Line>She had the actual intelligence between us. So while I</Line>
  <Line>went off to become a police officer, she went to college</Line>
  <Line>and then out into space, then...well, that's why I'm here, right?</Line>
  <Line>I slowly worked my way to the interior of the ship, and came</Line>
  <Line>across a room full of vats. The liquid inside was inky black</Line>
  <Line>and no light could pierce it. Beyond that, the door to the</Line>
  <Line>central testing chamber stood open, and I could hear the hum of</Line>
  <Line>machines within, though nothing else on board was powered.</Line>
  <Line>I slipped in carefully, my sidearm cocked.</Line>
  <Line>And there she was. Remma, or everything above her legs,</Line>
  <Line>suspended in a heap of tubes, cords and wires. Her eyes were</Line>
  <Line>glazed, and she mouthed a single phrase over and over and over...'RESCUE THEM.'</Line>
