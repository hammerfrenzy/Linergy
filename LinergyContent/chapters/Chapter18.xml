  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>I found the private testing chambers by accident and had to take a look.</Line>
  <Line>It was something out of one of those 21st century sci-fi films.</Line>
  <Line>Huge vats of liquids held naked bodies suspended in various</Line>
  <Line>states of degeneration. I found Tito and Gabrielle, their</Line>
  <Line>faces nearly intact but not much else. Something had stopped</Line>
  <Line>the breakdown near their heads, some sort of dark liquid.</Line>
  <Line>The last vat was swimming with that same liquid.</Line>
  <Line>Whoever that was obviously reacted violently to the tests,</Line>
  <Line>and something new was growing inside the tissue.</Line>
  <Line>I have to find out what Fastian is trying to accomplish.</Line>
  <Line>Here's to good fortune and seeing you again, brother. Retired officer or not.</Line>
