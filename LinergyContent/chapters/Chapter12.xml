  <Line>From the desk of Treavor A. Pattleson:</Line>
  <Line>To the dedicated crew of S.S. Abigail,</Line>
  <Line>As CEO and majority shareholder of TAPTech, let me be the first to</Line>
  <Line>congratulate your past successes on pioneering the Linergy technology.</Line>
  <Line>Though they do not know it yet, your sacrifice of body and mind will</Line>
  <Line>forever be remembered as the foundation on which an infinite number of</Line>
  <Line>possibilities launched back on humble Earth. When the Abigail returns,</Line>
  <Line>crowds will rain adulation and praise upon your findings, and your names</Line>
  <Line>will be etched in the minds of billions. And if tragedy should regretfully</Line>
  <Line>strike at any point of your momentous journey, I will personally make sure</Line>
  <Line>due remembrance befitting your contribution is carried out.</Line>
  <Line>I look forward to shaking every hand as you touch back on home soil.</Line>
  <Line>May science prevail always in the hands of masters like yourself.</Line>
