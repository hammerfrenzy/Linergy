  <Line>Dear Brother</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>I am beginning to believe there is no such 'virus' spreading</Line>
  <Line>through the junior dorms. If they quarantine the infected so</Line>
  <Line>soon, how does it keep popping up outside? And it's already</Line>
  <Line>been five weeks. Given that amount of time, they're either</Line>
  <Line>dead or we are being duped. The senior researchers and</Line>
  <Line>Dr. Fastian's cabal give no inclination anything is wrong,</Line>
  <Line>but then again why would they? Are they protecting us or</Line>
  <Line>silencing others? I don't have the evidence to say either way.</Line>
  <Line>Tell mum and dad hello and I send my love.</Line>
  <Line>And...how are your legs, brother?</Line>
