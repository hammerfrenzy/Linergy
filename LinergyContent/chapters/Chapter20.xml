  <Line>*Continued debriefing of Retired Officer Gunnard Muttier*</Line>
  <Line>The sick bay was empty, wiped down and sterile as a fresh scalpel.</Line>
  <Line>Most of the medical supplies had been untouched during the</Line>
  <Line>entire flight, save a few bandages, painkillers and other</Line>
  <Line>common supplies. I moved into each of the dormitories, and</Line>
  <Line>all but one were clean and looked untouched. All but hers.</Line>
  <Line>Either someone had experienced a hell of a fit in there,</Line>
  <Line>or someone was looking for something very specific.</Line>
  <Line>Fortunately for Remma, hiding anything - money, a</Line>
  <Line>weapon, bodies - was a required skill where we grew up,</Line>
  <Line>and within minutes I had located the loose fixture in</Line>
  <Line>the bathroom and the tightly wrapped datalog stashed inside.</Line>
  <Line>I still don't expect anyone to believe it. I certainly didn't, at first.</Line>
