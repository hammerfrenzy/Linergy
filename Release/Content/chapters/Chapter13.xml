  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>The two other associate researchers 'came down with something' a week</Line>
  <Line>ago and have not returned. I am left alone to test what I hope are</Line>
  <Line>still rocks while they lock themselves behind doors to do unspeakable</Line>
  <Line>things to my colleagues. Collection will eventually destabilize any</Line>
  <Line>material tested upon. Breakdown is inevitable. For the sake of the others,</Line>
  <Line>I have to secure evidence and hide. I've been going through more records;</Line>
  <Line>our employer is a very insistent man, and I have no doubt Fastian will</Line>
  <Line>soon turn to his own cabal without me to continue testing.</Line>
  <Line>The longer I hide, the more then numbers shift in my favor.</Line>
  <Line>Also worth noting is the appearance of what I'm dubbing 'rogue particles'.</Line>
  <Line>These anomalies move quickly and are capable of significant harm to collection.</Line>
