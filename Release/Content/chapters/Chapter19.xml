  <Line>*Initial debriefing of Retired Officer Gunnard Muttier*</Line>
  <Line>I arrived aboard the S.S. Abigail and immediately checked</Line>
  <Line>its life support systems for survivors. How anything could</Line>
  <Line>last aboard a dead ship for three months escapes me, but</Line>
  <Line>protocol is there for a reason. Nothing, of course.</Line>
  <Line>A fine layer of dust covered everything, but otherwise</Line>
  <Line>no signs of a struggle could be seen. Something must have</Line>
  <Line>taken them swiftly, else the crew would have struggled throughout the craft.</Line>
  <Line>Mercenaries or hijackers were straight out of the question.</Line>
  <Line>A sound from above jerked my head towards an air vent, and I jumped.</Line>
  <Line>Watching too many old sci-fi movies, I assured myself.</Line>
  <Line>Well, if illness was to blame, I'd have a hell of</Line>
  <Line>a lot of bodies to check in the sick bay.</Line>
