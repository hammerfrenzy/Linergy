  <Line>*Continued from Day 2 debriefing of Retired Officer Gunnard Muttier*</Line>
  <Line>So, after recording these last logs, she apparently began</Line>
  <Line>rigging the device holding this mini-black hole to direct</Line>
  <Line> every bit of power the ship had into it and through it, her.</Line>
  <Line>All those wires and tubes were the entirety from the electrical</Line>
  <Line>grid, life support systems and everything else she could</Line>
  <Line>possibly splice together. She slipped in and began graphing</Line>
  <Line>everything into her, along with an interface to the Abigail's</Line>
  <Line>main computer. She turned herself into an organic computer,</Line>
  <Line>losing the ability to communicate on our level, but she did</Line>
  <Line>manage to retain events up to that point in one last datalog.</Line>
  <Line>She and the ship together were able to contain that bottomless pit,</Line>
  <Line> but even then her supply of 'food' wasn't endless...that's why she called home.</Line>
