  <Line>FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR ISAAK FASTIAN</Line>
  <Line>Entry 306</Line>
  <Line>The girl still escapes my grasp. The remaining researchers</Line>
  <Line>spend every waking moment either testing or searching for</Line>
  <Line>her, narrowing the options to the cargo bay and the air filtration system.</Line>
  <Line>My plan is to smoke her out of the vents and into either</Line>
  <Line>one of the locked rooms or the cargo hold itself.</Line>
  <Line>Nonetheless, legitimate progress has emerged. The unstable</Line>
  <Line>nature of my test subject rendered the past iteration of the wavenet almost useless.</Line>
  <Line>So, I devised a way to overlay the wavenet with successive</Line>
  <Line>iterations of itself, creating a barrier of energy.</Line>
  <Line>Voracious is the only word I can ascribe to the anomaly's</Line>
  <Line>hunger. I know for certain that if the girl isn't caught soon, we will all soon be consumed.</Line>
