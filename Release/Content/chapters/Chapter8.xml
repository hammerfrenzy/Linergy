  <Line>From the desk of Treavor A. Pattleson:</Line>
  <Line>My illustrious doctor,</Line>
  <Line>You cannot fathom how happy your recent numbers have made me.</Line>
  <Line>Very soon you will be leaving that dusty rock behind for</Line>
  <Line>greener celestial fields, so to speak. I hope that our other</Line>
  <Line>project is coming along nicely. The scientific community and</Line>
  <Line>their financial backer rejoice at your work, doctor.</Line>
  <Line>Keep showing results like this, and they may name a wing after you!</Line>
  <Line>Your latest report discussed the small matter of</Line>
  <Line>'neurological anomalies'. I had my top men planetside decipher it,</Line>
  <Line>and afterward I concluded that whatever it is holds no immediate</Line>
  <Line>affect on our work.</Line>
  <Line>You are to continue as scheduled on both phases of the project.</Line>
