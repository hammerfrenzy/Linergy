  <Line>Unforeseen consequences seem to be the theme of the week.</Line>
  <Line>The last associate researcher mysteriously vanished</Line>
  <Line>despite being constantly monitored. I am taking appropriate</Line>
  <Line>steps to rectify the error, and there are only so many</Line>
  <Line>places one can hide on a space vessel. I expect her to</Line>
  <Line>be in custody within 48 hours. In the meantime, my hand</Line>
  <Line>has been forced sooner than expected; the first senior</Line>
  <Line>researcher volunteered himself for testing today.</Line>
  <Line>He showed a woefully low threshold to Linergy collection,</Line>
  <Line>and his body destabilized much quicker than any others. Age, perhaps?</Line>
  <Line>I must reign in this oversight soon. Its...appetite grows continuously.</Line>
