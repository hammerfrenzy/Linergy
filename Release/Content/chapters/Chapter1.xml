  <Line>Dear Brother,</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>I have decided not to stay mad at you.</Line>
  <Line>You called me a lackey and a puppet for taking this</Line>
  <Line>opportunity, but is the end not noble enough to justify</Line>
  <Line>the means?</Line>
  <Line></Line>
  <Line>I miss you, despite all of this.</Line>
  <Line>I miss Earth and trees and the fresh breeze and...well, </Line>
  <Line>atmosphere in general. Ours smells like plastic.</Line>
  <Line>We arrive at the Nebula tomorrow...well, approximately</Line>
  <Line>24 hours. Collection starts early.</Line>
